*** OVERVIEW ***

The Cash Register program is designed to calculate the amount of change to provide to a customer based on the price of the given product. The cashier is prompted to enter the amount of the product. Then they are prompted to enter the amount of money tendered from the customer. The program will then return the amount of change to provide and the largest denominations possible. Denominations that are not used are not displayed.

*** LESSONS LEARNED ***

This was an incredible opportunity to learn a lot of logical problem solving skills. During some of my research, I discovered the System.exit(0); command to terminate a program in a normal and successful exit. Although I was unable to use them in the late stages of development, I learned a lot about how useful methods would have been in this program. The planning phase and initial organization of this program were critical and those skills will be carried into other projects.
